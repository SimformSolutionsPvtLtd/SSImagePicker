# :books: How it works:

1. Gradle Dependency

* Add the JitPack repository to your project's build.gradle file
   - For Gradle version 5.x.x or less
   
   ```groovy
        allprojects {
            repositories {
                ...
    	        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
            }
        }
   ```
   - For Gradle version 6.x.x and above, in **settings.gradle** file inside **`pluginManagement`** block
  
   ```groovy
        pluginManagement {
            repositories {
                ...
                maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
            }
        }
    ```

* Enable data binding feature in your app's build.gradle file [(More Details)](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/start#build_environment).
    ```groovy
        android {
            ...
            buildFeatures {
                dataBinding true
            }
        }
    ```

* Add the dependency in your app's build.gradle file

    ```groovy
        dependencies {
            implementation 'com.github.SimformSolutionsPvtLtd:SSImagePicker:2.0'
        }
    ```
2. Add ImagePickerActivity into your AndroidManifest.xml. **`SSImagePicker`** is default theme for image picker activity. If you want to set custom theme check out [customization guide](docs/picker_ui_customization.md). Make sure to add the **`android:configChanges`** to handle the rotation.
```xml
<activity
    android:name="com.app.imagepickerlibrary.ui.activity.ImagePickerActivity"
    android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize"
    android:theme="@style/SSImagePicker" />
```

3. If you want to use Picker options bottom sheet then implement **`SSPickerOptionsBottomSheet.ImagePickerClickListener`** in your fragment or activity. **`onImageProvider`** method will give the selected provider type.

```kotlin
    val pickerOptionBottomSheet = SSPickerOptionsBottomSheet.newInstance()
    pickerOptionBottomSheet.show(supportFragmentManager,"tag")
    ....
    override fun onImageProvider(provider: ImageProvider) {
        when (provider) {
            ImageProvider.GALLERY -> {
                //Open gallery
            }
            ImageProvider.CAMERA -> {
                //Open camera
            }
            ImageProvider.NONE -> {}
        }
    }
```

4. Open Image Picker from activity or fragment via registering the image picker. It will give object of **`ImagePicker`** class.

```kotlin
    private val imagePicker: ImagePicker by lazy {
        registerImagePicker(this)
    }

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        ...
    }
    
    //To display the picker screen call open method on image picker object passing the picker type.
    imagePicker.open(PickerType.GALLERY)
```

5. Add customization to image picker via the image picker object. Checkout all the methods and default values for customization from the [picker config customization](docs/picker_config.md) section.
```kotlin
    imagePicker
            .title("My Picker")
            .multipleSelection(enable = true, maxCount = 5)
            .showCountInToolBar(false)
            .showFolder(true)
            .cameraIcon(true)
            .doneIcon(true)
            .allowCropping(true)
            .compressImage(false)
            .maxImageSize(2)
            .extension(PickExtension.JPEG)
    imagePicker.open(PickerType.GALLERY)
```

6. To get result in activity or fragment implement **`ImagePickerResultListener`**.

```kotlin
    class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity(), ImagePickerResultListener {
        ...
    }
```
7. Single Selection and the image captured from camera will be received in
   **`onImagePick(uri: Uri?)`** callback.

```kotlin
    override fun onImagePick(uri: Uri?) {
        //Do something with uri
    }
```
8. Multiple Selection uris will be received in **`onMultiImagePick(uris: List<Uri>?)`** callback.

```kotlin
    override fun onMultiImagePick(uris: List<Uri>?) {
        //Do something with uris
    }
```

# :pencil: Permissions

**SSImagePicker** Uses following permissions to display images. For system [Photo Picker](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared/photopicker) on Android 11+ no permission is required.

* API **21(Android 5)** to API **32(Android 12L)**: `android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
* API **33(Android 13)** onwards: `android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`
